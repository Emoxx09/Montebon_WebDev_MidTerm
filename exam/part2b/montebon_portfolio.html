        <h1>Hi, I'm Khyle!</h1>
        <h2>Web Development Student</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying Computer Science in UIC and I am at my 2nd year. In the current sem, we are taking up the Web Development course. The purpose of this portfolio is to show you a part of myself and my passion.</p>

        <h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my works which exemplifies all that I've learned in my Web Development course. If you wanna check the webpages for yourselves, click the picture of a certain project. I like to keep everything minimal (sorry if you're not into that ðŸ¥º). But I hope you enjoy looking at them!</p>

              <h3>Calendar</h3>
              <p>This project exemplifies my use of the table tag. It has challenged me to create a familiar object out of something as play as tables.</p>

              <h3>Poem</h3>
              <p>This project helped me get a good grasp of what HTML is. It entails a self-written poem that narrates why there are paths that are not taken.</p>

              </a>
              <h3>Markup</h3>
              <p>In this project, I appreciated the impact of highlighting on certain parts of the poem in the Poem Project. I practiced the craft of emphasis.</p>

              </a>
              <h4>Registration</h4>
              <p>The use of Forms and input tags were honed with the help of this project. It gave me an insight to what it is like to create a registration page.</p>

              </a>
              <h3>Master Detail</h3>
              <p>Master Detail taught me how to utilize HTML, CSS and JS altogether. The interactiveness of iFrame is my favourite thing that I've learned in this project. It's just fun linking a different webpage then viewing it on the iFrame while staying at that same page.</p>

              </a>
              <h3>Calendar with CSS</h3>
              <p>This is an enhanced version of my Calendar Project. I wanted it to have a chill theme, hence, the "snowy" palette. With the help of this project, I mastered some CSS tags such as color, font, and many more, that would surely be useful in the future.</p>

          <h3>VMG</h3>
          <p>My Ignacian Marian Spirit is imparted in this project where I can be seen reciting the Vission, Mission of UIC on cam and the Goals of UIC on mic. With the help of the audio and video tags, I am able to attach these media files in this webpage. In all honesty, this is my favourite project out of the bunch because I get to wear my uniform for the first time in a long time. I miss UIC and this project made me feel even just for a little while that everything is fine.</p>
