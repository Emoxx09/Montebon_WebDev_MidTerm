    	<h1>Why is That Road Less Taken?</h1>
    	<h4>Written by Khyle Montebon</h4>
    	<br></br>
    	<p>Walking along this trail</p>
    	<p>Along with all the others</p>
    	<p>I stare at the <em> other path </em></p>
    	<p>A <strong> disturbing thought </strong> bothers</p>
    	<br></br>
    	<p>"Why shouldn't we follow <em> that path</em>?</p>
    	<p>Why continue walking <em>here</em>?</p>
    	<p>Surely walking along <em>that path</em></p>
    	<p>Is not something to be <strong>feared</strong>!"</p>
    	<br></br>
    	<p>I let out a huge breath</p>
        <p>And did the <strong>unthinkable</strong></p>
    	<p>I tried out the <em>road less taken</em></p>
        <p>Then realized the <strong>incredible</strong></p>
    	<br></br>
    	<p>Some paths are just better left untaken</p>
    	<p>It'll only be harder, you see</p>
    	<p>Just like there are mountains you <strong>shouldn't climb</strong></p>
    	<p>Some paths lead to <strong>unreasonable guarantee</strong></p>
