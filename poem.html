    	<h1>Why is That Road Less Taken?</h1>
    	<p>Walking along this trail</p>
    	<p>Along with all the others</p>
    	<p>I stare at the other path</p>
    	<p>A disturbing thought bothers</p>
    	<br></br>
    	<p>"Why shouldn't we follow that path?</p>
    	<p>Why continue walking here?</p>
    	<p>Surely walking along that path</p>
    	<p>Is not something to be feared!"</p>
    	<br></br>
    	<p>I let out a huge breath</p>
    	<p>And did the unthinkable</p>
    	<p>I tried out the road less taken</p>
    	<p>Then realized the incredible</p>
    	<br></br>
    	<p>Some paths are just better left untaken</p>
    	<p>It'll only be harder, you see</p>
    	<p>Just like there are mountains you shouldn't climb</p>
    	<p>Some paths lead to unreasonable guarantee</p>
